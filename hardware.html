	<h3>The CPU has three main parts:</h3>
	<div class="info1">
		<h4>The Control Unit (CU)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The Control Unit's main job is to manage the fetching, decoding and execution of program instructions by following the fetch-decode-execute cycle.</li>
			<li>It also controls the flow of data inside and outside the CPU.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="info1" style="margin-top: 20px">
		<h4>The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The Arithmetic Logic Unit's job is to do all the calculations.</li>
			<li>This can include simple addition and subtraction, comparing the sizes of numbers and multiplications and divisions using repeated addition and subtraction.</li>
			<li>It can also include logic operations such as AND, OR and NOT nad binary shifts - don't forget that computers only process binary data.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="info1" style="margin-top: 20px">
		<h4>The Cache</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The cache is very fast memory in the CPU, much faster than RAM.</li>
			<li>It stores regularly used data so that the CPU can access it quickly the next time it's used.</li>
			<li>When the CPU requests data, it checks the cache first to see if the data is there. If not, it will fetch it from the RAM.</li>
			<li>They have a very low capacity and are expensive compared to RAM and secondary sotrage.</li>
			<li>
				There are three different levels of cache memory:
				<ol>
					<li>L1 is quicket but has the lowest capacity.</li>
					<li>L2 is slower than L1 but can hold more.</li>
					<li>L3 is the slower, but can hold the most.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>

</div>

<div id="RAM" style="display: none">
	<p>Read Only Memory is non-volatile memory, meaning data is not wiped off when the computer is turned off. It comes on a small, factory-made chip built into the motherboard and, as the name suggests, can only be read and not written to. It contains all the instructions a computer needs to properly boot up, called the Basic Input Output System (BIOS).</p>

	<div class="info1" style="margin-top: 30px">
		<h4>Virtual Memory is Secondary Storage used as extra RAM</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When the RAM is full, the computer needs somewhere else to put application data. It moves data that hasn't been used recently to a location on secondary storage, known as virtual memory.</li>
			<li>If the CPU needs to read data stored in virtual memory, it must move the data back to RAM. This is slower as data transfer rates are much slower on secondary storage than RAM.</li>
			<li>Using virtual memory can make a computer slow to respond when switching between applications.</li>
		</ul>

			<h4>Hard Disk Drives are high-capacity, reliable storage.</h4>
			<p>A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is made up of a stack of magnetised metal disks that spin thousands of times a second. Data is stored magnetically in small areas on the disk's cicular tracks. A moving arm can access these areas and read or write data. They have a long read/write life than SSDs and are relatively cheap, as well as having high capacity, which makes them reliable for use as an external storage. Because of their moving parts, HDDs are susceptible to damage by large impacts like being dropped, which could result in the loss of data.</p>

		<div class="column">
			<img src="https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/uk-860-qvo-sata-3-2-5-ssd-mz-76q4t0bw-frontblack-131383663?$720_576_PNG$" style="width:75%">
			<h4>Solid State Drives are fast and reliable secondary storage.</h4>
			<p>Unlike HDDs, a Solid State Drive (SSD) contains no moving parts, so they are more shock-proof than HDDs. Because they use flash technology, they have much faster read/write times than HDDs, meaning booting up your computer and opening programs and files is very speedy. They also don't require defragmenting, and are quieter. However, they are quite expensive and come with smaller storage options, as well as having a much shorter read/write life than HDDs, so they deteriorate faster.</p>

			<h4>Optical discs are cheap and robust secondary storage.</h4>
			<p>Optical discs come in a variety of forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CDs, which can hold around 700MB of data.</li>
				<li>DVDs, which can hold around 4.7GB of data.</li>
				<li>Blu-rays, which can hold around 25GB of data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>They have some advantages, such as their low cost per GB, portability, and their water and shock resistance. They are however, scratched easily. As well as that, their use these days are declining. As Internet speeds have increased, steaming and downloading services like Netflix, Spotify and Steam have removed the need for optical drives, not to mention that mobile devices like phones and tablets don't have optical drives.</p>
